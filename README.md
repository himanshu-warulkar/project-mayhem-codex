# 🧨 Project Mayhem Codex

> You are not your 9 to 5. You are your 3am commit.

A radically unorthodox, Fight Club–themed developer portfolio. Built not for recruiters, but for rebels. Every page, commit, and glitch serves a single purpose: to fracture the expectations of what a portfolio should be.


## 🛠️ Stack Deployed

- **Vite** – Lightning-fast frontend tooling
- **React + TypeScript** – Component logic with strict type discipline
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** – Accessible, customizable UI primitives
- **Framer Motion** – Motion as metaphor
- **Custom Easter Eggs** – Terminal overlay, glitch events, secret unlocks

## Philosophy

    “The things you own end up owning you.”
    This portfolio owns nothing. It shows everything. From low-level bootstraps to high-level abstraction, from AI models to real-world UIs—every bit is rebellion. No fluff. No fancy recruiterspeak.

## Attribution

Inspired by Fight Club, digital counterculture, and the refusal to build safe, sterile portfolios that scream sameness.
