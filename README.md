#  Project Mayhem Codex

A radically unorthodox, Fight Club–themed developer portfolio. Built not for recruiters, but for rebels. Every page, commit, and glitch serves a single purpose: to fracture the expectations of what a portfolio should be.

## Philosophy

    “The things you own end up owning you.”
    This portfolio owns nothing. It shows everything. From low-level bootstraps to high-level abstraction, from AI models to real-world UIs—every bit is rebellion. No fluff. No fancy recruiterspeak.

Inspired by Fight Club, digital counterculture, and the refusal to build safe, sterile portfolios that scream sameness.
